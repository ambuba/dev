*** Introduction

- type([]) => List
- dir(list) => Available methods
- help(list.reverse) => More info


*** Functions

- Organize code so it's reusable
- Function names are in lowercase and can have underscores
- Default arguments come last in a function definition

*** Lists & Tuples

- Retains the order of items in them
- Needs indices to access the items in a list
- Lists can be sorted in place (list.sort()) or by creating a copy and leaving the original list unaltered (sorted(list))
- List lookups are slow especially for large lists
- Index method finds the first occurence of a match
- Tuples -light-weight collections used to keep track of related but different items ()
- Tuples are immutable - Once defined, tuple items cannot be changed
- Tuples are not inplace sortable since they are immutable
- Unlike lists which store collections of similar items together, tuples are considered to contain a snapshot of data
- Tuple items are accessed similarly with indices like lists
- Tuples can be unpacked and stored into variables of our choice
